        <h1>How to Get Started</h1>
        <h2>Educate Yourself</h2>
        <p>Before diving into the practical steps, it's essential to understand what Bitcoin is and how it works. Take a moment to explore this site. Learn some of the basic terminology. Try to understand why you want to buy bitcoin and how you plan to use it. Proceed with caution.</p>
        <p><a href="#">Here</a> are some other great educational <a href="#">resources</a>.</p>

        <h1>Buying Bitcoin</h1>
        <h2>Peer-to-Peer Exchanges</h2>
        <p>This method is slightly more advanced as you may need to already have a wallet set up and use other aspects of Bitcoin such as the Lightning Network.</p>
        <p>A peer-to-peer (p2p) exchange can give you the added benefit of privacy. Exchanges like these do not require any personal information, preventing others from knowing about your Bitcoin purchases.</p>
        <h2>Centralized Exchanges</h2>
        <p>Centralized exchanges are easier to use and allow automatic bank withdrawals but will require personal information such as your name, address, social security number, or even some form of photo ID. The exchange will create a wallet for you and manage your private keys.</p>
        <p>Remember: "Not your keys, not your coins." There are many stories of exchanges not giving users their funds due to one reason or another.</p>

        <h1>Storing Your Bitcoin</h1>
        <h2>Not your keys, not your coins!</h2>
        <p>Contrary to what you might think, your Bitcoin wallet does NOT store your Bitcoin. It stores your private key, which is used to send your Bitcoin when you want to. This means your Bitcoin can be retrieved even if your wallet is lost or broken, as long as you maintain a record of your private key.</p>
        <h2>Types of Wallets</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Hardware Wallets (cold storage)</li>
            <li>Software Wallets (hot storage)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section even">
        <h1>Hardware Wallets</h1>
        <h2>Also known as cold storage</h2>
        <p>This is the recommended method for maximum security and control over your coins.</p>
        <h2>Choosing a Device</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It should use Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).</li>
            <li>Buy your device directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>NEVER buy a used device, as your funds may be stolen.</li>
            <li>NEVER use a device that appears to have been tampered with when you receive it, as your funds may be stolen.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One recommended device is the Blockstream Jade. Other good options are the SeedSigner and, for more advanced users, the ColdCard.</p>
        <p>You will also need a software wallet that can communicate with your hardware wallet. Sparrow Wallet is a good option, but ensure it uses FOSS and is compatible with your device.</p>
        <h3>Protect your recovery seed with a method like a punched metal plate.</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="section odd">
        <h1>Software Wallets</h1>
        <h2>Also known as hot wallets</h2>
        <p>This is NOT the recommended method to store your coins. When using this method, you are storing your private key on your computer, leaving it vulnerable to online attacks.</p>
        <h3>If anyone gains access to your private key, they can steal your funds!</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="section even">
        <h1>Receiving Bitcoin</h1>
        <h2>Your private key is KEY!</h2>
        <p>To receive Bitcoin, share your wallet's public address with the sender. They will use this address to send Bitcoin to your wallet.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section odd">
        <h1>Sending Bitcoin</h1>
        <h2>Your private key is KEY!</h2>
        <h3>How to Send Bitcoin:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Open your wallet and select the "Send" option.</li>
            <li>Enter the recipient's public address.</li>
            <li>Specify the amount of Bitcoin to send.</li>
            <li>Confirm the transaction by entering your private key or using your hardware wallet.</li>
            <li>Review and confirm the transaction details.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section even">
        <h1>Next Steps</h1>
        <h2>Don't Stop Learning</h2>
        <p>There is much more to do with Bitcoin than mentioned here. Consider these next steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Run your own node.</li>
            <li>Mine Bitcoin at home.</li>
            <li>Stay updated on the development of the Bitcoin network.</li>
            <li>Learn about challenges Bitcoin faces, such as the introduction of arbitrary data on the blockchain.</li>
        </ul>
